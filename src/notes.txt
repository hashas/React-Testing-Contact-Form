Things I expect or did not expect to see in the app:

1. I didn't expect "first name" field to have a "maxLength"
2. "email" field did not test for an email type string
3. "submit" button:
    - not submitting any data anywhere
    - not clearing the input fields

What "expected" behaviour do I want to test for:

1. that "first name" field should not have a maxLength
2. "email" field tests for an "input=email"
3. clear input fields after submission
4. check "first name", "last name", and "email" all required
